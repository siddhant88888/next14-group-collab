Flow of this code:

useApiMutation is called (somewhere, update later) and it 
takes a parameter, which will probably be create 

now apiMutation is assigned useMutation(mutationFunction)

which means apiMutation will take any ReactMutation as a parameter

apiMutation is basically the create mutation under a different 
name

Then comes mutate 
which sets setPending to true --> This will probably be used for
the loading screen 

and the mutate through apiMutation takes the payload as the 
parameter which will probably be in the format of the object 
args from create --> org.id: v.string();
                     title: v.string();
